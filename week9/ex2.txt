Increase:
We can put repeated page numbers in order to get a high hit/misses rate. For example: (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).

Decrease:
We can put unique numbers of pages in order to get a low hit/misses rate. This way, we won't have any hits because each page will occur only once and thus, will always miss.
For example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
